# SingleFixingBarrier
A Single Fixing Single Barrier Fade In Option gives a European payoff at expiry if a contractually fixed single barrier has been knocked on a specified single fixing (observation) date and gives nothing if otherwise. The “Out” version gives nothing if the barrier is knocked and a European payoff otherwise
